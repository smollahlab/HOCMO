    "100 most frequent NER disease entities were manually categorized into disease groups (broader classifications of disease such as breast cancer, lung cancer, mental health disorder). For exact categorizations, see \"most_frequent_disease.xlsx\" file. The five most frequent disease categories were selected and 3 most enriched articles for each category were manually annotated. For list of extracted relations by diseaes category, see \"relations_csv/\" directory. Among the extracted relations, those already represented by synonymous terms in CRO were indicated. This notebook contains code that streamlined this process as well as code that was used to determine the percentage of manually extracted relations that are covered by CRO."
