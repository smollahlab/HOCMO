# Descriptive Statistics on NER output

### Description
This directory contains code that was used to manipulate and perform downstream analysis of NER output of selected Cell and Nature articles. It contains the following notebooks:
- **disease_analysis**: Used to find the most common relations among articles enriched for disease entities.
- **pickle_analysis**: Perform various quantitative and qualitative statistics about NER output such as distribution of word lengths, proportion of entities which are disease, number of entities per article, etc.
- **venny_analysis**: Used to create the files needed to quantify the number of overlapping terms between NER genetic entities and crewDB terms.

### Prerequisites
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9.12+
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) 2.0.2+
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) 1.24.3+
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html) 0.11.2+
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) 3.7.1+
- [wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) 1.9.2+
For running entity normalization from scratch you will additionally need to download and install [UMLS Lexical Tools](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LSG/Projects/lvg/current/docs/userDoc/install/install.html) ([2023 Release](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LSG/Projects/lvg/current/docs/userDoc/install/releaseNotes.html)) into this directory. Follow the [setup instructions](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LSG/Projects/lvg/current/docs/userDoc/install/install.html). To run the Norm tool on the autogenerated NormInput, run `norm i:NormInput.txt o:NormOutput.txt`.
