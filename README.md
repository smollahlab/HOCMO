# Higher-Order Correlation Model

## Description:
A Generalized Higher-Order Correlation Model (HOCMO) tool to generate scores modeling the strength of the relationship among triplicate or quadruplet entities using a tensor-based approach

## Prerequisites:
Developmental environment is provided via dockerfile. We also provide a requirements.txt if a local environment is preferred. Package is also available for installation on PyPi.

## Installation:
```
pip install hocmo
```
